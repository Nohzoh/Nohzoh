## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Product Technology Director at [Centreon](https://www.centreon.com/), where I lead innovation and manage infrastructure and software architecture.

My professional background includes extensive experience as a developer in Java, C++, NodeJS, and Go.  
I also have solid expertise in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), particularly with Terraform.

Beyond my work, I'm passionate about open-source, data science, and science in general.
